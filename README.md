Jupyter notebooks:

- 2021-08-04_Deer_Island_nonscaled_ave_Beta_function_viral_shedding_dynamics_MCMC_asymptomatic_clean.ipynb : code to run the shedding model and produce data files of model results
- 2021-08-04_plot_shedding_with_wolfel_data_1x_6x_24x_nonscaled_ave.ipynb : code to use data files and results from above notebook to plot shedding model results with clinical
shedding data and produce higher resolution figures for paper
- 2021-08-04_stoten_revision_nonscaled_ave_plot_fig1F_with_100_MCMC.ipynb : code to use data files and results from first notebook to plot shedding model results with observed
wastewater data and produce higher resolution figures for paper
